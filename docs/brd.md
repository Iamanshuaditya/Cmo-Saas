# BRD — Business Requirements Document

## 1) Problem Statement

Fractional CMOs run multiple SaaS clients simultaneously. Their work is high leverage, but their workflow is broken:

* Client context lives in scattered docs + calls + memory
* Strategy gets rewritten each time
* Execution tracking is chaotic across teams/tools
* No compounding knowledge system
* Onboarding a new client takes too long (unbillable hours)

**Result:** Fractional CMO output doesn’t scale; quality drops, burnout risk rises, and margins cap.

## 2) Target Personas

### Primary Persona: Fractional / Interim CMO (Sonesh)

* Handles 5–15 clients
* Needs fast clarity and repeatable systems
* Sells outcomes (growth, pipeline, positioning)
* Uses Docs/Sheets/Notion + Slack/WhatsApp + calls

### Secondary Personas

* CMO Outsourced team members (strategists, content leads)
* Founder/CEO client (consumer of plans/updates)
* Product/RevOps counterpart at client side (execution partner)

## 3) Core Jobs-to-be-Done

1. **Onboard a new client fast** without drowning in calls/docs
2. **Produce a credible 30/60/90 plan** in hours, not weeks
3. **Keep all client context + decisions** in one place
4. **Track execution** without chasing teams
5. **Reuse frameworks** across clients without being generic
6. **Prove impact** through clear reporting and “what changed” logs

## 4) Pain + Frequency + Cost

### Pain

* Context switching + repeated strategy creation
* Misalignment across founders/teams
* No single “source of truth”
* Missing follow-ups, unclear ownership
* Hard to demonstrate ROI to clients

### Frequency

* Weekly (status updates, alignment, pipeline reviews)
* Monthly (strategy refresh, board decks)
* Every new client (onboarding, GTM planning)

### Cost

* 5–15 hours unbillable per client onboarding
* Slower execution = delayed revenue outcomes
* Reputation risk if client says “strategy is vague / nothing moved”

## 5) Market Reality / Why existing tools fail

* Notion/Docs store notes but don’t generate structured strategy outputs
* PM tools track tasks but don’t capture strategic reasoning
* Generic AI tools are too broad, not opinionated for SaaS GTM
* Consulting templates exist, but they don’t integrate into execution + memory

## 6) Business Goals

* Build a product that reduces onboarding time by 60–80%
* Make every client engagement “compound” through reusable systems
* Create a sticky recurring tool inside the Fractional CMO workflow

## 7) Product Success Metrics (Business)

* Activation: time to first completed 30/60/90 plan < 60 minutes
* Retention: weekly active usage per client workspace
* Expansion: average # client workspaces per account grows month over month
* Revenue: high willingness-to-pay (₹15k–₹50k/mo for solo; higher for teams)
